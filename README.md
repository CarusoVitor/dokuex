# Dokuex ðŸ”¢
Dokuex is a Pokemon characteristic matching tool. 

Dokuex queries all pokemons that match given characteristics, e.g type, generation, moves, etc using data from the [PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) project. 

It was inspired by the [pokedoku](https://pokedoku.com/) website.
